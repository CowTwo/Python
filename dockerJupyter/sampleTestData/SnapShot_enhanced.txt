To fully understand source and record, it will be useful to see how result recording is set up.

When a module or channel is created in the simulation, the OMNeT++ runtime examines the
@statistic properties on its NED declaration, and adds listeners on the signals they mention as
input. There are two kinds of listeners associated with result recording: result ﬁlters and result
recorders. Result filters can be chained, and at the end of the chain there is always a recorder. 80,
there may be a recorder directly subscribed to a signal, or there may be a chain of one or more
filters plus a recorder. Imagine it as a pipeline, or rather a “pipe tree”, where the tree roots are
signals, the leaves are result recorders, and the intermediate nodes are result filters.
